= Koan BSP for STM32MP1 - Yocto Project 3.1 'dunfell' LTS

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir yocto-stm32-dunfell
$: cd yocto-stm32-dunfell
$: repo init -b dunfell -u https://github.com/koansoftware/koan-stm32mp-bsp-repo
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: MACHINE=stm32mp1-disco DISTRO=openstlinux-eglfs source setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.
